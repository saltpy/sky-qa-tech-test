-behat needs to be run from inside the acceptance folder to pickup the features - top level script perhaps?
-ugly regex for covering floats and whole numbers - gone with two functions to improve readability but not happy that this is DRY enough - some code comments perhaps or similar?
-factorial should guard against invalid inputs from floats or negative numbers
-factorial should possibly use a library function but dont want to add a dependency to the project
